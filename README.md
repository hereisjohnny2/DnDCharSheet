# ROLLING DICES!	

This project aims to provide a good plataform for Dungeons & Dragons players.
The goal is to build an enterily online character sheet that can hold your characters' whole information so you can play wherever you want to.

Although we do have plans for future features we are sticking to the basics, which is the character sheet itself, since we are still learning a lot of stuff (plus we are learning all by ourselves while living a 'normal' life).
But anyway, every idea is welcome (so is any help!).

The project itself is contained inside NextSession folder, to run it you'll need to set up a virtual enviroment and install the requirements.
I'm currently using MondoDB as my database with djongo library.
If you wish to use the same as I am, follow these steps:


		1) Create an account at mongodb.com:
		it is free, you get a Cluster with 512MB storage space.
		
		2) Build a cluster:
		3) Set up your Connection
		Just follow this link instructions: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKB_4HWKMCc&t=184s
		You'll have to have the database you just mentioned. In order to do so you can create the database using an GUI for MongoDB (I'm using Compass, but you can use another one like Robo 3T), you can use the link as guidance: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqvKv3P18yY
		4) Set up a virtualenviroment and install the requirements.txt
		5) Run the Project

Djongo translates Django Models Code to NoSQL, so you can just keeping using SQlit3 if you wish as well, no changes needed.
If you prefer to use some other database, make sure everything is configured properly.
